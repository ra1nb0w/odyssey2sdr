/* 	This program interfaces the LTC2208 to a PC over Ethernet.
	The data from the LTC2208 is in 16 bit parallel format and 
	is valid at the positive edge of the LTC2208 122.88MHz clock.
	
	The data is processed by a CORDIC NCO to produce I and Q
	outputs.  These are decimated by 640/1280/2560 in CIC and CFIR filters to 
	give output data at 192/96/48kHz to feed to the PHY and hence via 
	the Ethernet to a PC.
	
	The program takes microphone/line-in samples from an ADC at 48kHz
	and passed them to the PC via Ethernet. The PC process these and returns them as 
	I&Q signals.  These are passed to CIC interpolating filters (x2560) then 
	to a complex input CORDIC NCO. The ouput of the CORDIC is at the required user
	frequency and passed to the final DAC.  
	
	The data format over Ethenet is the same as that used my Metis.

	LED0 incates PHY status - fast flash if no Ethernet connection, slow flash if 100T and on if 1000T
	
	Then wait a second (for the network to stabilise) then  attempt to obtain an IP address using DHCP
	- supplied address is in YIADDR.  If the DHCP request either times out, or results in a NAK, retry four 
	additional times with a 2 second delay between each retry.
	
	If after the retries a DHCP assigned IP address is not available use an APIPA IP address or an assigned one
	from Flash.
	
	Inhibit replying to a Metis Discovery request until an IP address has been applied.
	
	LED6 indicates the result of DHCP - on if ACK, slow flash if NAK, fast flash if time out and 
	long then short flash if static IP
	
	Once an IP address has been assigned set IP_valid flag. When set enables a response to a Discovery request.
	
	Wait for a Metis discovery frame - once received enable HPSDR data to PC.
	
	Enable rest of code.

/*	
     Calculates  ratio = fo/fs = frequency/122.88Mhz where frequency is in MHz
	 Each calculation should take no more than 1 CBCLK

	 B scalar multiplication will be used to do the F/122.88Mhz function
	 where: F * C = R
	 0 <= F <= 65,000,000 hz
	 C = 1/122,880,000 hz
	 0 <= R < 1

	 This method will use a 32 bit by 32 bit multiply to obtain the answer as follows:
	 1. F will never be larger than 65,000,000 and it takes 26 bits to hold this value. This will
		be a B0 number since we dont need more resolution than 1 Hz - i.e. fractions of a hertz.
	 2. C is a constant.  Notice that the largest value we could multiply this constant by is B26
		and have a signed value less than 1.  Multiplying again by B31 would give us the biggest
		signed value we could hold in a 32 bit number.  Therefore we multiply by B57 (26+31).
		This gives a value of M2 = 1,172,812,403 (B57/122880000)
	 3. Now if we multiply the B0 number by the B57 number (M2) we get a result that is a B57 number.
		This is the result of the desire single 32 bit by 32 bit multiply.  Now if we want a scaled
		32 bit signed number that has a range -1 <= R < 1, then we want a B31 number.  Thus we shift
		the 64 bit result right 32 bits (B57 -> B31) or merely select the appropriate bits of the
		64 bit result. Sweet!  However since R is always >= 0 we will use an unsigned B32 result

/* 
	The gain distribution of the transmitter code is as follows.
	Since the CIC interpolating filters do not interpolate by 2^n they have an overall loss.
	
	The overall gain in the interpolating filter is ((RM)^N)/R.  So in this case its 2560^4.
	This is normalised by dividing by ceil(log2(2560^4)).
	
	In which case the normalized gain would be (2560^4)/(2^46) = .6103515625
	
	The CORDIC has an overall gain of 1.647.
	
	Since the CORDIC takes 16 bit I & Q inputs but output needs to be truncated to 14 bits, in order to
	interface to the DAC, the gain is reduced by 1/4 to 0.41175
	
	We need to be able to drive to DAC to its full range in order to maximise the S/N ratio and 
	minimise the amount of PA gain.  We can increase the output of the CORDIC by multiplying it by 4.
	This is simply achieved by setting the CORDIC output width to 16 bits and assigning bits [13:0] to the DAC.
	
	The gain distripution is now:
	
	0.61 * 0.41174 * 4 = 1.00467 
	
	This means that the DAC output will wrap if a full range 16 bit I/Q signal is received. 
	This can be prevented by reducing the output of the CIC filter.
	
	If we subtract 1/128 of the CIC output from itself the level becomes
	
	1 - 1/128 = 0.9921875
	
	Hence the overall gain is now 
	
	0.61 * 0.9921875 * 0.41174 * 4 = 0.996798

	Decode IF_Rx_ctrl_0....IF_Rx_ctrl_4.

	Decode frequency (both Tx and Rx if full duplex selected), PTT, Speed etc

	The current frequency is set by the PC by decoding 
	IF_Rx_ctrl_1... IF_Rx_ctrl_4 when IF_Rx_ctrl_0[7:1] = 7'b0000_001
		
      The Rx Sampling Rate, either 192k, 96k or 48k is set by
      the PC by decoding IF_Rx_ctrl_1 when IF_Rx_ctrl_0[7:1] are all zero. IF_Rx_ctrl_1
      decodes as follows:

      IF_Rx_ctrl_1 = 8'bxxxx_xx00  - 48kHz
      IF_Rx_ctrl_1 = 8'bxxxx_xx01  - 96kHz
      IF_Rx_ctrl_1 = 8'bxxxx_xx10  - 192kHz

	Decode PTT from PC. Held in IF_Rx_ctrl_0[0] as follows
	
	0 = PTT inactive
	1 = PTT active
	
	Decode Attenuator settings on Alex, when IF_Rx_ctrl_0[7:1] = 0, IF_Rx_ctrl_3[1:0] indicates the following 
	
	00 = 0dB
	01 = 10dB
	10 = 20dB
	11 = 30dB
	
	Decode ADC & Attenuator settings on Angelia, when IF_Rx_ctrl_0[7:1] = 0, IF_Rx_ctrl_3[4:2] indicates the following
	
	000 = Random, Dither, Preamp OFF
	1xx = Random ON
	x1x = Dither ON
	xx1 = Preamp ON **** replace with attenuator
	
	Decode Rx relay settings on Alex, when IF_Rx_ctrl_0[7:1] = 0, IF_Rx_ctrl_3[6:5] indicates the following
	
	00 = None
	01 = Rx 1
	10 = Rx 2
	11 = Transverter
	
	Decode Tx relay settigs on Alex, when IF_Rx_ctrl_0[7:1] = 0, IF_Rx_ctrl_4[1:0] indicates the following
	
	00 = Tx 1
	01 = Tx 2
	10 = Tx 3
	
	Decode Rx_1_out relay settigs on Alex, when IF_Rx_ctrl_0[7:1] = 0, IF_Rx_ctrl_3[7] indicates the following

	1 = Rx_1_out on 

	When IF_Rx_ctrl_0[7:1] == 7'b0001_010 decodes as follows:
	
	IF_Line_In_Gain		<= IF_Rx_ctrl2[4:0]	// decode 5-bit line gain setting

	A LED is flashed for the selected period on the positive edge of the signal.
	If the signal period is greater than the LED period the LED will remain on.
