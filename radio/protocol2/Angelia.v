				   - Set NR = 2, Sync OK,  saved as today's date. 
					- Mod so that only Rx0 and Rx1 can be synced.  Independent phase words for both receivers.
					- All OK, saved as today's dat2 _2.

					- try 4 receives, Sync not work, save as today's date _phase_word_3
					- try 7 receives,  Sync not work nor Rx3 ???
					- hold fifo clear until spd_rdy, 7 receivers OK but no Sync. Save as today's date _phase_word_4
					- unfold receivers. 7 receivers but Rx6 did fail and all will fail sometimes after deselecting Sync. 
				28 - Check Rx fifo is empty after Sync changes of status before continuing.
				   - NR = 2;
					- Connect fifo_clear to test LED to check that fifo is being reset.
					- works - saved as today's date.
					- replaced set_min_delay -from PHY_RX_CLOCK -to PHY_RX_CLOCK -4 with set_multicycle_path
					- works - saved as today's date _2 (and ping works!). 
				29 - Added items from Alex's network code to SDC file. Changed PHY delay to 1.2nS and updated sdc. 
				   - NR = 7, Receivers OK but not Sync.  Changed PHY delay back to 2nS. 
					- By forcing Rx1 phase word to Rx0 phase word then all receivers OK and Sync works. 
					- Try selecting Rx1 phase word dependent on Sync[0] setting. Runs but possible Sync problem.
		 Jul   2 - Revert to normal phase word selection. Receivers appear to work but not sure about Sync.
		         - Saved as today's date and sent to Warren etc for testing. 
				 3 - Warren reports that Rx1 and Rx5 seem to share the same frequency - confirmed - no idea why!  Unrolled Rx generation - no change.
				 4 - Unroll frequency selection in Hi Priority C&C, seems to have fixed the same frequency problem.
				   - Saved as today's date and sent to Kirk for assistance.
					- Code just stops running for some reason. 
				21 - Changed phy_cfg to turn off Tx delay and set Rx delay to F0 or C0 or 00 - all seem to work the same. 
				22 - Changed phy_cfg to use different Rx clock delays.
				   - Changed sdc to use different PHY data_in settings.  Checked 7 receivers appears OK, still not sure about Sync. 
					- Saved as today's date.
				23 - Changed KK so that each receiver can be set to different frequency. Works but some receivers fail when chip is cold.
					- Try unfolding Rx generation.  Appears to work OK, ping works for a few mins until FPGA warms up. 
					- Saved as today's date and sent to Warren for testing.
				25 - force same phase word to Rx0 and Rx1. Sync works but phase offset.  
				   - Force CORDIC reset when selecting Sync - no difference
					
					____________________________________________________________________________-
					
					- Two receiver version to speed up debug.
					- force Rx1 to use Rx0 phase word when in Sync mode - works OK.
					- force CIC reset when selecting sync - works OK.
					- force FIR reset when selecting sync - Rx hangs when Sync selected. 
					- independent phase words for Rx0 and Rx1 - not work
					- change High_Priority_CC so that Rx0 and Rx1 phase words are captured at the same time. Works until Rx1 is tuned.
					- when Sync active force Rx1 phase word to equal Rx0 phase word - wont run! see line 1038.
					- try setting Rx1 phase word  = Rx0 phase word  in High_Priority_CC when Sync active - no change
				26 - try reset CORDIC phase to zero when reset active. Works until you change frequency then need to set Sync again.
				   - remove reset code from High_Priority_CC  - same result.
					- remove reset from CIC filters - same result.
					- try just reseting CORDIC phase rather than other variables - same result.
					- use cdc_mcp to move receiver phase words to Rx clock domain - same result i.e. works until you change frequency.
					- use Sync to force Rx1 = Rx0 phase word - when you select Sync no Rx data sent?
					- force code to read phase at same time - using cdc_mcp - not work 
					- try using cdc_sync - works, can drag tune very slowly and phase preserved.
		         - set Rx1 = Rx0 phase word - code not run 
					- revert to separate Rx0 and Rx1 phase words. 
					- set Rx1 = Rx0 in High_Priority_CC - code runs but phase not work.
					- revert to separate Rx0 and Rx1 phase words.
				27 - Also reset CORDIC when new phase word arrives using Alex_data_ready - will not start.
					- Just use Alex_data_ready - Rx always at 0Hz, reasonable since as soon as new phase word is received it is set to zero. 
					- Move Alex_data_ready stobe to just before new Rx0 and Rx1 phase words.  Works most of the time but can tune such that phases are not correct.
					- Try Alex_data_ready directly after new Rx phases - works but blip in Rx audio as you tune not unexpectedly.
					- Try right at end - works OK. Sync does not hold after changing sampling rates.
				29 - Force Rx1 = Rx0 sample rate. Sync OK when changing sample rates.
				   - Force Rx1 = Rx0 sample rate from KK as well as Rx0 = Rx1 frequency.  Sync OK when changing sampling rate.
				   - Try setting Rx1 = Rx0 phase when Sync set again - remove reset of phase accumalator when frequency changes - WORKS!!!

				 8 - modified ping check sum - not work and Rx0 not work. Ping error is due to incorrect data being received.
				 9 - modified ping code to use dual clock fifo and clock tx side on negedge. Ping works but not Sync.

								-created userADC_clk, 30.72MHz clock for Angelia_ADC.v which provides a 7.68MHz clock to 
									the ADC78H90 chip, increasing its previous sampling rate x10
								-replaced Angelia_ADC.v with version from Orion_MkII_v1.6 firmware
								-replaced CC_encoder.v with version from Orion_MkII_NP_v1.2 firmware
								- replaced Ethernet/sdr_send.v with version from Orion_MkII_NP_v1.2
								-added pk_detect_reset and pk_detect_ack to Angelia.v
								-added user_analog1 and user_analog2 (deleted user_analog) to Orion.v
					- added debounce_PTT to FPGA_PTT to fix bug with external PTT IN via pin13 on ANAN-100D accessory jack
					- added userADC_clk as a 30.72MHz generated clock to Angelia.sdc
					- changed PHY Rx clock skew settings values[6] = 16'h70FF (from 16'hF0FF)
					- changed FW version number to v11.6
					- removed all max/min delay constraints from Orion.sdc
					- retimed/compiled iteratively until timing closed
					
		 May 20  - recompiled using Quartus V17.0. Auto update of all Megafunctions.
					- replaced max clock delays for RX_clock with mulitpath
			  21  - used icmp.v and icmp_fifo.v from Hermes-Lite project. Ping sometimes works, when fails payload is wrong. 
			      - updated dhcp.v from Hermes-Lite project. Works OK. 
2018	Feb  10  - Merged files from Hermes-Lite project and those provided by Rick, N1GP.
				   - Fixed bug that caused non response to Discovery request.
				   - retimed	
					- set version to 11.7
					- Archived project as Angelia_Protocol_2_v11.7-Quartus-17
					- removed almost_full and almost_empty flags since no longer required by Simon, G4ELI, SDR-Radio software
					- corrected text explaining external 10MHz reference operation
					- released as 11.7 and archived as before. 
		Mar    3 - set Rx1 input = DAC data for Thetis debug testing
		         - // Remove ability for other than Rx1 to receive DAC data since not supported by other HW at the moment.
					- Modified sdr_send so that phy_ready requires no pending data from Rx0 fifo.
				   - Rx1 now has input data selectable again.
				   - Added Samplerate input to mux_clear to reset code if sample rate changes 
					- modified mux_clear such that either Mux or SampleRate changing state runs code. 
					- Remove ability for other than Rx1 to receive DAC data since not supported by other HW at the moment.
				 4 - Remove fifo_empty from mux_clear since can hang in that state otherwise. 
				   - Added mux_clear fifo_clear output to reset DDC0 and DDC1 - no improvement.
				 7 - Testing Diverstity - set DEBUG_LED10 = C122_SyncRx[0][1] to confirm signal from Thetis - looks OK. 
				10 - Force DDC0 and DDC1 to have same sampling rate when Mux active
			      - set DEBUG_LED10 to indicate amplitude difference between DDC0 and DDC1 when in Mux mode.	

2019	Mar  2 - (N1GP) Worked with Chris/W2PA and Doug/W5WC on an issue with FPGA_PTT
			   coming in late and cutting off the beginning of the CW_char.
			   Or'd FPGA_PTT with Alex_data[27] assigned to runsafe_Alex_data,
			   added mixing of rx audio with sidetone during CW_PTT and break_in,
			   QSK much improved.
			 - Added latching of data in initial states of SPI, TLV320_SPI, and Attenuator.
			 - Added a checksum in the send_more reply to a Host programmer to validate image transfer.

2019	Mar 30 - (N1GP) Changed to 4 rx's as it's easier to compile and make timing.
			   Upgraded to Quartus 18.1
			 - Changed FW version number to v1.18

2019	Apr 15 - (N1GP) Fixed Mic Boost (and other) issues in TLV320_SPI
			 - Changed FW version number to v1.19

2019	Apr 17 - (N1GP) Updated phy timing to 5270
			 - Changed FW version number to v1.20

2019    Apr 28 - (N1GP) Fixed a merge issue which caused the Antenna selection to not work
                         mistakenly merged some Orion changes in to High_Priority_CC.v
                         - Changed FW version number to v12.1

2020   Jan 4 - (N1GP) Fixed DHCP issue where a dhcp transaction not bound for the local MAC would get passed up and interfere
                        with ongoing network traffic. Passed dhcp_enable down to udp_recv.v so the request was only considered
                        when enabled. Enforced that TR relay was disabled if PA_Enable was set to disable.
                        Moved the LED clock to CLK_25MHZ, added 'set_clock_groups -exclusive -group' for various clocks.

2021   Jul 8 - (N1GP) Added beta_version for better tracking of test releases (byte 23 of discovery, per protocol2 doc v3.8).
                       Removed/fixed stuck mode in sdr_send.v, merged HL2 dhcp and icmp updates in.
                       Experimenting with phase step adjustment of tx_pll PHY_TX_CLOCK. 8 RX slices are enabled.
                         - Changed FW version number to v12.1

2021   Aug 10 - (N1GP) Updated to Quartus 20.1. Removed for loops in sdr_send.v, seemed to fix a lot of SEQ errors.

	Divide the 122.88MHz clock to give a 10MHz signal.

	present the EXOR output will be a 10MHz square wave. When passed through 
	the loop filter this will provide a dc level of (3.3/2)v which will
	set the 122.88MHz VCXO to its nominal frequency.
	The selection of the internal or external 10MHz reference for the PLL
	is made using a PCB jumper; some boards select this automatically when the external reference is applied.
